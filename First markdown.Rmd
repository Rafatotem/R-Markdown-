## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
a <- rbind(c(2, 5),
           c(1, 3))
b <- c(33, 19)
solve(a, b)
```
```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 100)
```
```{r}
sum(1:100)
```
```{r}
5050/100
```

```{r}
df<-data.frame(c("A","B","C","D"),c("D", "E", "F", "G"))
```
